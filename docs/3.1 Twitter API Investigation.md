# Twitter API Investigation

As mentioned before Twitter has provided a REST API for requesting
relevant Twitter data. [The link to the API is here.][link] There seems
to be a lot of relevant documentation on request limits, however, there
doesn't seem to be any sort of introductory tutorial. In that case I'll
try following [the Tweepy documentation]][tweepy] which is an API
client to allow "Twitter for Python."

It seems that to interact with the API you need a key and access token
which can be created by creating a Twitter app in [the Twitter apps
section](https://apps.twitter.com). Once the app was created I got my
key and access token.

Key: AME1iqfrYjkrbNrz587MIhbxQ
Access Token: 294751529-Cj9QCFb6ODQN09xiWsSKmHzORb9VnwqFwlG3Ufwf
Access Token Secret: Secret Key

From most references Tweepy seems to be the Python libray of choice for
interacting with the Twitter data so I'll give it a shot with that.

First I'll create a virtualenv for this work (with Python 3.5).

```bash
mkvirtualenv twitter_project
```

Install Tweepy from pip.

```bash
pip install tweepy
```

We can create the script now in tweepy.py.
