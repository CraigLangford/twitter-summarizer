# Project

After a few months of trying to decide what project to do I've finally
decided to do a twitter summarizer. The final project will be a web
page with different twitter stories, summarize, allowing people to
upvote and downvote stories, as well as comment on them. The structure
of the site will be similar to reddit allowing the top stories to reach
the top of the page, and lesser stories to be voted down.

Behind the scenes this will be much more complicated as it is not user
generated content, as reddit does, but auto-generated content based on
trending tweets. Therefore this project is divided into two main phases:

1. Collecting twitter data and building a story generating algorithm.

2. Building the front end, a webpage people can go to and interact with
   the bespoke stories.

For this project to work best, and allow me to have a more modular
design is to have both sections interact through an API. Part 1 will be
able to run completely separate from 2. And the website will be able
to run with a separate database allowing certain API calls for new
stories. An important feature in 1 will be taking feedback from the
website, so building a feedback loop will be something to keep as a
possibility if the website does gain any traction.

Finally, keeping this project within the realm of something that is
deployable is something to keep in mind. In that case I'm going to take
advantage of as many tools as possible. If it ain't broker, don't fix
it.
